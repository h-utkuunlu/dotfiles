* Notes on the setup

** nvidia gpu

If an nvidia gpu is present and you want to configure TLP to optimize / only use intel
mode:
0. Check [[https://linrunner.de/tlp/faq/powercon.html#hybrid-graphics][this page from TLP settings]]
1. install nvidia-prime
2. Run "sudo prime-select intel"
3. Reboot

nvidia-smi should print something along the lines of "cannot run"
